My name is Peetu Kuoppala and I'm in the Interactive media study path.

I'm a bit older than most other students here since I used to study engineering 
a long time ago and decided to switch directions and start over, 
so here I am.

My main interests are visual effects, procedural 3d modeling and animation. 
I have some programming experience from my engineering days but I've not done any web development before.

I haven't grown up yet and maybe I never will. 
I just want to make cool shit - and by my logic, the more tools I have at my disposal, the more possiblities I have for making that happen.
